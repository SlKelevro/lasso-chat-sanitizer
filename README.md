# Lasso ChatGPT Sanitizer Browser Extension

Tech stack:
* TypeScript
* React + React Compiler
* PNPM (important! project uses `pnpm-lock.yaml`, not `package-lock.json`)
* Vite

For development mode use `pnpm run prod-watch` command, it will keep the `dist/` folder up to date with code changes.

For a finalized prod build use `pnpm run build`.
